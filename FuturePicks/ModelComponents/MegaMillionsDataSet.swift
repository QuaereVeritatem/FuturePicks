// Mega Millions draw frequencies last updated:   11/3/17
// [Just 100 draws of data]...data skewed since draw numbers changed

// ***New rules change : As of 10/31/17 ...it goes from 5 balls [1-75] + PB[1-15] to the current  5 balls [1-70] + PB[1-25]
// TODO list: 1) Seperate data (lotto# freq's) into its own file in resources folder 2) remove all logic (randomNumber, mmMegaBallNumbersAndDrawFreqMatrix and mmMegaBallNumbersAndDrawFreqMatrix) and place it in a 'controller' specific file
