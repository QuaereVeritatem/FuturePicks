/*
 This is the TODO list of items that need to be done:
 1) Put past picks for MegaMillions into database
 2) Put past picks for Lotto Texas into database
 3) Put past picks in permanent/persistent memory(possibly CoreData)
 4) *** Have random pick results put in ascending order
 5) Future feature: ability to search through past random number picks?
 6) start using "// MARK: - Navigation" (or other thinsg besides navigation) to find things easier
 7) change storyboard to reflect changes in the sketch regarding distances between banners
